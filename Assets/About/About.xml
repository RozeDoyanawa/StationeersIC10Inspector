  <Description>[h1]IC10 Inspector/Debugger[/h1]
    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersLaunchPad Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersLaunchPad plugin.

    Adds an inspector and debugger for IC10 chips. Readout includes current values for registers and stack. Updated every tick.
    The debugger can frame-step IC10 programs and also shows current code-line and the fiew surrounding it.
    The Debug state is not saved on world save, any paused/slowed chips will run at full speed on loading a save. So, if you have code that you are unsure of will cause mayhem if "started", stop the housing properly before saving.
    
    Tested to work in singleplayer. Untested in P2P multiplayer and dedicated servers due to update to beta.

    v0.3
    * If you have subscribed and enabled [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3528329094&amp;searchtext=ic10+extender]IC10 Extender mod[/url], you can now use the newly added break command to halt the processor at a given line. Unfortunately this requires a precious code line, but it is what it is.
