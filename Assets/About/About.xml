  <Description>[h1]IC10Inspector[/h1]
    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersMods Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersMods plugin.

    Adds an inspector and debugger for IC10 chips. Readout includes current values for registers and stack. Updated every tick.
    The debugger can frame-step IC10 programs and also shows current code-line and the fiew surrounding it.
    The Debug state is not saved on world save, any paused/slowed chips will run at full speed on loading a save. So, if you have code that you are unsure of will cause mayhem if "started", stop the housing properly before saving.
    
    Tested to work in singleplayer. Untested in P2P multiplayer and dedicated servers due to update to beta.

    Please report any bugs in the appropriate discord channels:
